                        <p>
                            Happy Valentine's Day, my love. I want you to know how deeply grateful I am to have you in my life. I appreciate you more than words can express, and I am constantly reminded of 
                            how lucky I am to have such an understanding and sweet girlfriend like you. Your kindness, patience, and support mean everything to me.
                            I miss you so much. I miss your smile, your laugh, and your warm hugs. We may not be together right now, but please know that you are in my heart and mind 26/9.
                            I love you. Thank you for being my person and for showering me with so much love and affection. Happy Valentine's Day, Jellah.
                        </p>
